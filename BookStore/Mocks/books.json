Zdziarski shows finance companies, large institutions and others where the exploitable flaws lie in their code, and in this book he will show you as well, in a clear, direct, and immediately applicable style. More importantly, this book will teach the reader how to write more secure code to make breaching your applications more difficult. Topics cover manipulating the Objective-C runtime, debugger abuse, hijacking network traffic, implementing encryption, geo-encryption, PKI without depending on certificate authorities, how to detect and prevent debugging, infection testing and class validation, jailbreak detection, and much more. Hacking and Securing iOS Applications teaches corporate developers and penetration testers exactly how to break into the latest versions of Apple's iOS operating system, attack applications, and exploit vulnerabilities, so that they can write more secure applications with what they've learned. With the App Store reaching over a half-million applications, tools that work with personal or confidential data are becoming increasingly popular. Developers will greatly benefit from Jonathan's book by learning about all of the weaknesses of iOS and the Objective-C environment. Whether you're developing credit card payment processing applications, banking applications, or any other kind of software that works with confidential data, Hacking and Securing iOS Applications is a must-read for those who take secure programming seriously",

Ideas can come from anyone—designers or developers, marketing managers or CEOs—and this book is about bringing those ideas to life. iOS is a remarkable platform, both from a technology standpoint and as a pure business opportunity. With over 10 billion apps downloaded through the iTunes App Store, and over 50 million new iOS devices expected to ship in 2011, no other platform puts big business and individual developers on a level playing field like iOS does. Needless to say, if you have an idea for an app, now is the time to make it happen. Whether you’re a designer or a developer, this book will help you: Create basic user interface elements Understand navigation metaphors and practices Design for multiple devices Customize system UI elements Incorporate system-provided and custom animations Use touch- and motion-based gestures Create UIViews and UIViewControllers using Core Graphics Avoid rejection by the iTunes App Store",

With this revised and expanded edition, you’ll dig into Cocoa and learn how to work effectively with Objective-C and Xcode. This book covers iOS 5 and Xcode 4.3 in a rigorous, orderly fashion—ideal whether you’re approaching iOS for the first time or need a reference to bolster existing skills. Many discussions have been expanded or improved. All code examples have been revised, and many new code examples have been added. The new memory management system—ARC—is thoroughly explained and all code examples have been revised to use it. New Objective-C features, such as declaration of instance variables in the class’s implementation section, are described and incorporated into the revised example code. Discussion of how an app launches, and all code examples, are revised for project templates from Xcode 4.2 and later. Other new Xcode features, including the Simulator’s Debug menu, are covered, with screen shots based on Xcode 4.2 and later. The discussion of Instruments is expanded, with screen shots—by popular request! Storyboards are explained and discussed. The explanation of view controllers is completely rewritten to include iOS 5 features, such as custom parent view controllers and UIPageViewController. The Controls chapter now includes iOS 5 interface customizability and the appearance proxy. New features of interface classes are discussed, including tiling and animated images, new table view features, new alert view styles. Coverage of frameworks such as Core Motion and AV Foundation is greatly expanded. New iOS 5 classes and frameworks are also discussed, including Core Image and UIDocument (and iCloud support). Important iOS 5 changes that can break existing code are explicitly called out in the text and listed in the index.",

        "description": "Today, virtually every non-trivial iPhone and iPad app must manage data—quickly, smoothly, reliably, and with minimal impact on the CPU to conserve battery life. Core Data, Apple’s ready-made data persistence layer, can help you achieve all these goals. In Core Data for iOS, two leading iOS developers teach you the entire Core Data framework from the ground up. Writing for intermediate-to-advanced iOS developers, Tim Isted and Tom Harrington thoroughly explain how Core Data is used on iOS devices, introduce each of its primary classes, and show how they interact to provide amazing functionality with minimal configuration. You’ll learn how to store, fetch, and validate data; provide it efficiently to views; and much more. Isted and Harrington first give you a firm grounding in the technology, and then present real-world examples. They present multiple sample projects, as well as a start-to-finish, chapter-length case study. Coverage includes • Understanding Core Data’s features, classes, and interactions • Using Core Data in MVC-based iOS app development • Mapping relational data to object models, and building them with Xcode 4’s Data Modeler • Working with managed objects and using UITableView to display them • Creating predicates to match numbers, data, and objects • Maintaining compatibility across versions of an app’s data model • Tracking managed object contexts across view controllers • Using Core Data’s automatic Undo functionality • Integrating abstract entities, entity inheritance, and multiple view controllers into a complete app • Optimizing for iOS devices’ tight memory limits • Diagnosing and fixing common Core Data problems Introducing Addison-Wesley’s new Core Frameworks Series, written for experienced iOS developers by world-class Mac and iOS developers, these are the first comprehensive, code-rich reference guides to Apple’s Core Frameworks.",
